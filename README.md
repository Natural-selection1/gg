# ![icon](src-tauri/icons/24x24.png) GG - Gui for JJ

![screenshot](src-tauri/resources/screenshot.png)

GG is an experimental GUI for [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj). The idea is to take advantage of Jujutsu's composable primitives to present an interactive view of your repository. What if you were always in the middle of an interactive rebase, but this was actually good?

## Installation
GG is a desktop application with a keyboard & mouse interface, written in [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). Binaries are available for several platforms on the [releases page](https://github.com/gulbanana/gg/releases). Use the `.dmg` or `.app.tar.gz` on MacOS, and the `.msi` or `.exe` on Windows. To build from source, run `npm install` followed by `npm run tauri build`.

### Setup 
Put `gg` on your path and run it from a Jujutsu workspace, or launch it separately and use the Repository->Open menu item to select a workspace directory. Tips:
- On MacOS, try adding `/Applications/gg.app/Contents/MacOS/` to your PATH environment variable. On Windows, add `C:\Program Files\gg\`.
- Using `gg &` on MacOS/Linux or `start gg` on Windows will run in the background without blocking your shell.
- You can pass the argument `--debug` for a bunch of extra logging to stdout.

### Configuration
GG uses `jj config`; `revset-aliases.immutable_heads()` is particularly important, as it determines how much history you can edit. GG has some additional settings of its own, with defaults and documentation [here](src-tauri/src/config/gg.toml).

## Features
GG doesn't require [JJ](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/) to run, but you'll need it for tasks GG doesn't cover. What it *can* do:
- Use the left pane to query and browse the log. Click to select revisions, double-click to edit (if mutable) or create a new child (if immutable).
- Use the right pane to inspect and edit revisions - set descriptions, issue commands, view their changes and parents. 
- Drag revisions around to rebase them; move them into or out of a revision's parents to add merges and move entire subtrees. Or just abandon them entirely.
- Drag files around to squash them into new revisions or throw away changes (restoring from parents).
- Drag branches around to set their pointers.
- Right click on any of the above for more actions.
- Undo anything with ‚ü≤ in the bottom right corner.

More detail is available in [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

### Future Features
There's no roadmap as such, but items on [the to-do list](TODO.md) may or may not be implemented in future. Just about everything is subject to change for now, including the name.

### Known Issues
GG is in early development and will have bugs. In theory it can't corrupt a repository thanks to the operation log, but it never hurts to make backups. 

If your repo is "too large" some features will be disabled for performance. See [the default config](src-tauri/src/config/gg.toml) for details.

## Development  
Recommended IDE setup: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode).

Some useful commands:
* `npm run test` - execute unit tests.
* `npm run gen` - update the IPC message types in src/messages from src-tauri/messages.rs.
* `npm run tauri dev` - launch a debug build with automatic reloading.
* `npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin` - create a fat binary for MacOS.
* `npm run tauri dev -- -- -- --debug` - run locally with --debug. Yes, all three `--` are necessary.
